# Chapter 3: Analysis Configuration

In [Chapter 2: Differential Signal Analysis](02_differential_signal_analysis_.md), we learned how to convert the raw S-parameter data into differential parameters like Sdd11, which better represent how high-speed signals actually travel. Now that we have our channel data ready, how do we tell our analysis tool *exactly* what kind of simulation or calculation to perform?

## Setting Up the Simulation: The Control Panel

Imagine you're about to use a sophisticated flight simulator. Before you take off, you need to set things up, right? You need to choose the aircraft type, the weather conditions, the departure airport, the destination, and maybe even simulate specific emergencies.

In the world of high-speed channel analysis, especially when running simulations like COM (Channel Operating Margin), we need a similar "control panel." We need a way to tell the simulation engine:
*   Which channel "blueprint" ([S-Parameter Data Handling](01_s_parameter_data_handling_.md)) should we use?
*   How should the transmitter (Tx) try to compensate for signal loss? (Equalization settings)
*   How should the receiver (Rx) try to clean up the signal? (Equalization settings)
*   How much background noise should we assume?
*   Are there any extra components, like chip packages, to include?
*   What specific results or quality metrics should we calculate (like COM itself, or perhaps ERL - Effective Return Loss)?

This "control panel" is what we call the **Analysis Configuration**.

**Our goal in this chapter:** Understand what the Analysis Configuration is, why it's important, and how `kr100G-ck` uses it to run flexible and repeatable simulations.

## What is an Analysis Configuration?

The Analysis Configuration is simply a collection of all the parameters and settings that define *how* a specific simulation or analysis should be run. Instead of hard-coding these settings directly into the main simulation program (which would make it very inflexible), we define them separately.

Think of it like a recipe for our simulation:
*   **Ingredients:** The S-parameter file for the channel, maybe models for chip packages.
*   **Instructions:** Transmitter settings (e.g., "use a 3-tap equalizer with these strengths"), receiver settings (e.g., "use a CTLE with this peak gain"), noise levels ("add this much random noise"), and the desired output ("calculate the COM value").

## Why Use Separate Configuration?

1.  **Flexibility:** Easily test different scenarios. Want to see how the channel performs with a better receiver? Just change the receiver settings in the configuration, no need to modify the core simulation code!
2.  **Reusability:** Use the same simulation engine for many different channels or test conditions just by swapping configuration files.
3.  **Clarity:** Keeps the simulation code cleaner (focused on *how* to simulate) and the configuration file focused on the *what* (what settings to use).
4.  **Sharing:** Easier to share test setups â€“ just share the configuration file along with the S-parameter data.

## How `kr100G-ck` Handles Configuration

In `kr100G-ck`, the configuration is typically defined in external files. The most common format used is an **Excel spreadsheet (`.xlsx`) file**. Sometimes, MATLAB script files (`.m`) or direct command-line arguments can also be used to pass settings.

This Excel file acts as our control panel. It has specific sheets or sections where you can enter values for various parameters defined by standards like IEEE 802.3 (which specifies COM for Ethernet).

**Example Parameters you might find in a config file:**
*   `f_b`: The signaling rate (baud rate).
*   `N_b`: Number of bits to simulate.
*   `tx_ffe_taps`: Number and values for the Transmitter Feed-Forward Equalizer.
*   `rx_ctle_g_dc_tune`, `rx_ctle_f_p1_tune`, `rx_ctle_f_p2_tune`: Settings for the Receiver Continuous Time Linear Equalizer.
*   `sigma_bn`, `sigma_rj`: Levels for different types of noise.
*   `package_model_tx`, `package_model_rx`: Paths to S-parameter files representing the chip packaging.
*   `ERL_ONLY`: A flag to tell the tool to calculate only ERL instead of the full COM.

## Using Configuration in `kr100G-ck`

Let's look at how we might tell `kr100G-ck` to run a COM analysis using a specific configuration file. The project includes functions (like `run_com_ieee8023_93a_320` often called from scripts like `run_com_script.m`) that take the configuration file path as an input.

**Use Case:** Run a COM analysis for the channel `my_channel.s4p` using the settings defined in `my_config.xlsx`.

**Input:**
*   Path to the configuration file (`my_config.xlsx`).
*   Paths to the S-parameter files for the main channel and any noise sources.

**Output:** The function will run the COM simulation according to the settings in `my_config.xlsx` and return the calculated results (e.g., the COM value, ERL, etc.).

**Example Code Snippet (Simplified from `run_com_script.m`):**

```matlab
% Define the configuration file path
config_file = 'C:\path\to\configs\my_config.xlsx';

% Define the S-parameter file for the signal path
signal_path_s4p = 'C:\path\to\data\my_channel.s4p';
% Define S-parameter file(s) for noise/crosstalk (if any)
% Here, we assume 1 FEXT and 0 NEXT files
noise_path_s4p = 'C:\path\to\data\my_fext_noise.s4p';
num_fext = 1;
num_next = 0;

disp(['Using Configuration: ' config_file]);
disp(['Analyzing Channel: ' signal_path_s4p]);

% Call the main COM execution function, passing the config file
% and the S-parameter files.
% (This function is part of the COM Execution Framework)
results = run_com_ieee8023_93a_320(config_file, num_fext, num_next, signal_path_s4p, noise_path_s4p);

% Display the results (e.g., the COM value)
disp('Analysis Complete. Results:');
disp(results);
```

**What happens when you run this?**

1.  You define the locations of your configuration file and your channel data files.
2.  You call the `run_com_ieee8023_93a_320` function.
3.  Crucially, you pass `config_file` as the first argument.
4.  The function will *read* `my_config.xlsx`, load all the settings, and then run the complex COM simulation using those specific settings applied to the provided channel data (`my_channel.s4p` and `my_fext_noise.s4p`).
5.  Finally, it returns the calculated metrics in the `results` variable.

If you wanted to test with different equalizer settings, you would simply:
1.  Edit `my_config.xlsx` (or save a new version, e.g., `my_config_stronger_eq.xlsx`).
2.  Change the `config_file` variable in the script.
3.  Re-run the script. The simulation engine remains the same, but it now uses the new "recipe."

## Under the Hood: How Configuration is Read and Used

When you call a function like `run_com_ieee8023_93a_320`, one of the first things it does is process the configuration file.

**Simplified Flow:**

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User Script
    participant COM Function (e.g., run_com_...)
    participant Config Reader
    participant Simulation Core
    participant Config File (e.g., .xlsx)

    User Script->>COM Function: Call with config_file_path, s4p_paths,...
    COM Function->>Config Reader: Read settings from config_file_path
    Config Reader->>Config File: Open and parse file
    Config File-->>Config Reader: Parameter values
    Config Reader-->>COM Function: Return settings structure (e.g., 'config_params')
    COM Function->>Simulation Core: Initialize simulation
    COM Function->>Simulation Core: Apply settings from 'config_params' (Tx/Rx EQ, noise, etc.)
    COM Function->>Simulation Core: Run simulation using S4P data
    Simulation Core-->>COM Function: Simulation results
    COM Function-->>User Script: Return results
```

**Code Glimpse: Reading the Configuration**

Inside the COM execution functions (part of the [COM Execution Framework](06_com_execution_framework_.md)), there's typically code dedicated to reading the configuration file. This might involve calling helper functions like `read_com_config_100G` or similar logic.

```matlab
% Simplified concept from within a COM execution function

function results = run_com_ieee8023_93a_320(config_file, ...)
    % --- 1. Read Configuration ---
    disp(['Reading configuration from: ' config_file]);
    % Call a helper function to parse the Excel/MAT file
    % This returns a structure holding all parameters
    config_params = read_com_config(config_file); % Fictional simplified function name
    disp('Configuration loaded.');

    % --- 2. Load S-Parameters (using Chapter 1's concepts) ---
    % ... code to load S-parameter files specified directly ...
    % OR sometimes, S-param file paths are ALSO in the config_params!

    % --- 3. Run Simulation Core (using loaded config) ---
    disp('Starting COM simulation...');
    % Pass the loaded settings structure to the core engine
    simulation_output = perform_com_analysis(config_params, s_parameter_data, ...);
    disp('Simulation finished.');

    % --- 4. Extract Metrics (using Chapter 7's concepts) ---
    % Extract specific results like COM, ERL based on what was requested
    % (often also guided by flags in config_params)
    results = extract_metrics(simulation_output, config_params);

end % End of function
```

*Explanation:* The main function first calls a dedicated reader (`read_com_config`) to process the specified `config_file`. This reader understands the format (e.g., Excel) and extracts all the parameters into a MATLAB structure (`config_params`). Later, when the core simulation (`perform_com_analysis`) is run, this `config_params` structure is used to set up the transmitter, receiver, noise levels, and other aspects according to the user's choices.

## Why is Configuration Central?

The Analysis Configuration ties everything together:
*   It points to the channel data ([S-Parameter Data Handling](01_s_parameter_data_handling_.md)).
*   It dictates the settings for the core simulation ([COM Execution Framework](06_com_execution_framework_.md)).
*   It specifies which final numbers ([Metric Extraction & Comparison](07_metric_extraction___comparison_.md)) we care about.
*   It enables powerful [Automation Scripting](08_automation_scripting_.md) by allowing scripts to easily loop through different configurations.

Mastering how to create and modify configuration files is key to leveraging the full power and flexibility of `kr100G-ck`.

## Conclusion

In this chapter, we learned about the crucial concept of Analysis Configuration â€“ the "control panel" or "recipe" for our high-speed channel simulations. We saw that it allows us to define all the parameters and settings (like equalization, noise, and channel models) separate from the core simulation code, often using external files like Excel spreadsheets. This provides immense flexibility for testing different scenarios without rewriting code. We looked at how `kr100G-ck` uses configuration files as input to its main analysis functions and how these settings guide the simulation process internally.

Now that we understand how to load channel data, process it for differential signaling, and configure the analysis settings, we can dive into specific analysis techniques. The next chapter explores a common method for finding impedance mismatches in a channel: Time Domain Reflectometry.

**Next:** [Chapter 4: Time Domain Reflectometry (TDR)](04_time_domain_reflectometry__tdr__.md)
