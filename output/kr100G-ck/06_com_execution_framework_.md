# Chapter 6: COM Execution Framework

In [Chapter 5: Impedance Profile Calculation](05_impedance_profile_calculation_.md), we learned how to map the electrical "width" (impedance) along our channel. This helps us spot potential trouble spots. But how do we know if the *entire system* – the transmitter, the channel with all its imperfections, the receiver, and various sources of noise – will actually work well enough together? We need a way to simulate the whole flight, not just inspect the runway.

## What's the Goal? Simulating the Data's Flight

Imagine you're designing a new airplane route. You know the characteristics of the plane (transmitter/receiver), the planned route including potential mountains (the channel's S-parameters), and typical weather forecasts (noise, jitter). Before actually flying passengers, you'd run a sophisticated flight simulator to predict if the plane can reliably reach its destination under these conditions.

**Channel Operating Margin (COM)** is like that flight simulator, but for high-speed data signals. It's a standardized method (defined by the IEEE 802.3 Ethernet standards) that takes all the known characteristics of a communication link and simulates how well data signals can "fly" through it. It predicts whether the signal quality at the end will be good enough to meet a very low target error rate (like less than one bit error in a trillion!).

The **COM Execution Framework** in `kr100G-ck` refers to the process and the scripts/functions used to set up and run this complex COM simulation.

**Our goal in this chapter:** Understand what the COM simulation does and how `kr100G-ck` provides tools to launch and manage this simulation easily.

## What is COM Trying to Achieve?

COM doesn't just look at one aspect of the channel; it considers the whole picture:
1.  **The Channel:** How the signal degrades as it travels through cables, connectors, and circuit board traces (using the [S-Parameter Data Handling](01_s_parameter_data_handling_.md)).
2.  **The Transmitter (Tx):** How the transmitter chip tries to pre-compensate for expected channel losses using equalization (settings defined in the [Analysis Configuration](03_analysis_configuration_.md)).
3.  **The Receiver (Rx):** How the receiver chip tries to clean up the degraded signal using its own equalization (also defined in the [Analysis Configuration](03_analysis_configuration_.md)).
4.  **Noise & Jitter:** The random disturbances that affect the signal (electrical noise from other components, timing variations called jitter - again, defined in the [Analysis Configuration](03_analysis_configuration_.md)).

By simulating all these factors together, COM calculates a final number, usually expressed in decibels (dB). This number represents the "margin" or "headroom" the system has.
*   **If COM > 3 dB (typically):** The simulation predicts the link will work reliably (Pass).
*   **If COM < 3 dB (typically):** The simulation predicts the link might have too many errors (Fail).

Think of it as the simulator predicting if the flight will arrive safely with extra fuel (margin) to spare.

## How `kr100G-ck` Runs the COM Simulation

Running the full COM calculation involves many complex steps defined by the IEEE standard. `kr100G-ck` provides wrapper functions (like `run_com_ieee8023_93a_320`) that hide this complexity. You don't need to know every detail of the simulation engine; you just need to tell the wrapper function *what* to simulate.

**Use Case:** You have a channel described by `my_channel.s4p`, maybe some noise from a nearby channel in `my_noise.s4p`, and you've defined all your simulation settings (Tx/Rx types, noise levels, etc.) in an Excel file called `my_com_config.xlsx`. You want to run the COM simulation and find out the resulting COM value.

**Input:**
*   The path to your [Analysis Configuration](03_analysis_configuration_.md) file (e.g., `'my_com_config.xlsx'`).
*   The number of noise sources (e.g., 1 FEXT, 0 NEXT).
*   The paths to the S-parameter files for the main signal path and the noise path(s).

**Output:** A MATLAB structure (variable) containing various results from the simulation, most importantly the calculated `COM` value.

**Example Code (based on `run_com_script.m`):**

```matlab
% Define the configuration file (our "control panel")
config_file = 'my_com_config.xlsx';

% Define the S-parameter file for the main signal path
signal_path = 'my_channel.s4p';
% Define the S-parameter file for a noise source (e.g., FEXT)
noise_path = 'my_noise.s4p';
num_fext = 1; % We have one FEXT noise source
num_next = 0; % We have zero NEXT noise sources

disp(['Using Configuration: ' config_file]);
disp(['Running COM for Channel: ' signal_path]);

% --- Call the COM Execution Function ---
% This function takes the config and S-parameter info
% and runs the whole simulation.
% 'run_com_ieee8023_93a_320' is specific to certain IEEE clauses.
com_results = run_com_ieee8023_93a_320(config_file, num_fext, num_next, signal_path, noise_path);

% --- Display the Result ---
disp('COM Simulation Complete.');
% The result is a structure; let's display the COM value (if available)
if isfield(com_results, 'COM')
    fprintf('Calculated COM = %.2f dB\n', com_results.COM);
else
    disp('COM value not found in results structure.');
    disp(com_results); % Display the whole structure if COM field missing
end
```

**What happens when you run this?**

1.  You tell MATLAB where your configuration file and channel/noise S-parameter files are located.
2.  You call the `run_com_ieee8023_93a_320` function (or a similar one provided by `kr100G-ck`).
3.  This function acts as the main entry point to the COM Execution Framework. It reads your `config_file`, loads the necessary S-parameters using the methods from [Chapter 1: S-Parameter Data Handling](01_s_parameter_data_handling_.md), sets up the entire simulation based on the rules in the config file, runs the complex calculations, and finally returns the results (including the crucial COM value) in the `com_results` variable.
4.  The script then prints the calculated COM value.

## Under the Hood: Launching the Simulation

What happens inside the `run_com_ieee8023_93a_320` function (or similar COM wrappers)? It orchestrates several steps:

1.  **Read Configuration:** Parses the `.xlsx` or `.m` file specified (using concepts from [Chapter 3: Analysis Configuration](03_analysis_configuration_.md)) to get all the simulation parameters (baud rate, Tx/Rx settings, package models, noise levels, etc.).
2.  **Load S-Parameters:** Reads the specified signal path and noise source `.s4p` files into MATLAB variables ([Chapter 1: S-Parameter Data Handling](01_s_parameter_data_handling_.md)).
3.  **Prepare Channel Data:** Combines the main channel S-parameters with any specified package models (also S-parameters) and noise contributions according to the configuration settings. It converts these to the differential and common-mode representations needed.
4.  **Invoke COM Engine:** Calls the core COM algorithm functions. This is where the heavy lifting happens – calculating the pulse response, simulating the equalization, computing noise levels, and finally determining the signal-to-noise ratio that leads to the COM value. (This engine itself is complex and follows IEEE standards).
5.  **Package Results:** Collects the COM value and other important metrics (like ERL, intermediate calculations) into a MATLAB structure.
6.  **Return Results:** Sends the results structure back to the calling script.

**Simplified Flow:**

    participant User Script
    participant COM Wrapper (e.g., run_com_...)
    participant Config Reader

    participant COM Engine (Core Algorithm)

    COM Wrapper-->>User Script: Return results structure
```

**Code Glimpse: Calling the COM Function (from `TP0V_example.m`)**

This example shows how another script within the project might call a COM function. It passes configuration settings using `varargin` (variable arguments), which is another way besides a dedicated config file.

```matlab
% Inside TP0V_example.m

% com_m_file holds the name of the COM function to call (e.g., 'com_ieee8023_93a_340')
% config_file is the path to a config file
% fixture_file is the path to an S-parameter file
% varargin holds extra configuration options passed as arguments

com_call = str2func(com_m_file); % Get a handle to the function

% Add some specific options for this TDR/ERL analysis
varargin = [varargin {'OP.pkg_len_select'} , {'[ 2 ]'} ]; % Select package option
varargin = [varargin {'OP.AUTO_TFX'} , {'1'} ];       % Auto-detect fixture delay
varargin = [varargin {'param.snpPortsOrder'},{'[3 4 1 2 ]'} ]; % Specify port order

% --- Call the COM function ---
% Passes the config file, zero noise sources (0, 0), the S-param file,
% and the extra options in varargin.
results{1} = com_call(config_file, 0, 0, fixture_file, varargin{:});

% The 'results{1}' variable now holds the structure returned by the COM function.
```

*Explanation:* This code snippet demonstrates calling the core COM function (whose name is stored in `com_m_file`). It shows that configuration settings can come from both a main `config_file` and additional parameters passed directly in the function call (`varargin`). The call `com_call(...)` initiates the entire COM execution process described above, and the output is stored in `results{1}`. This highlights the flexibility of the framework – using files or direct arguments to control the simulation.

## Why is the COM Framework Important?

The COM Execution Framework is the heart of `kr100G-ck`'s predictive power:
*   **Standardized Prediction:** It implements an industry-standard method (IEEE 802.3 COM) for assessing link viability.
*   **Holistic View:** It considers all major factors affecting signal quality (channel, Tx/Rx EQ, noise).
*   **Automation:** By wrapping the complex simulation in callable functions, it allows for easy [Automation Scripting](08_automation_scripting_.md) to test many channels or configurations quickly.
*   **Decision Making:** The resulting COM value provides a clear metric to decide if a channel design is likely to pass or fail compliance.

It brings together the data handling, configuration, and underlying physics into a single, powerful simulation.

## Conclusion

In this chapter, we explored the COM Execution Framework – the system within `kr100G-ck` responsible for running the Channel Operating Margin simulation. We learned that COM is like a sophisticated flight simulator for data signals, predicting link quality based on the channel (S-parameters), transmitter/receiver settings, and noise (all defined in the [Analysis Configuration](03_analysis_configuration_.md)). We saw how wrapper functions like `run_com_ieee8023_93a_320` make it easy to launch this complex simulation by simply providing the configuration and channel files. The framework handles reading inputs, running the core engine, and returning the results, primarily the COM value (in dB), which indicates the predicted link margin.

The COM simulation generates a wealth of data beyond just the final COM value. How do we extract and compare these different metrics effectively? That's what we'll cover in the next chapter.
